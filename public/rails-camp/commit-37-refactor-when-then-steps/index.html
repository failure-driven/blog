<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> how did you find it?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I was super keen to join you guys, I knew I have not done this before
so it was exciting to be taken on this quick tour. I have not worked with
Given/When/Then testing stuff in this way. Most recently I have been writing
in elixir and thought this would be fun.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> do you think you learnt anything today?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> what I learnt was the process, step by step. I am used to testing more
on the backend and no so much on frontend also more at the isolated unit test
level and not this idea of steps flowing through the whole system. I haven&rsquo;t
done flow testing, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s still an integration test</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> what were your expectations of this pairing experience?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> it was an interesting situation because it was all setup and I felt
there were expectations on me to do things a certain way and do something in
paritcular, I was not sure what to do, which direction to drive it in but you
guys manage to keep me guided on the path you were aiming for.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> how do you think we managed that?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I liked the playfull time, it was fun! I can&rsquo;t figure Selena out, you
can put that on the record, it was certainly a good time.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> anything we can do better?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I would do it agian, but maybe Michael can also wear a stripy shirt
next time?</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> do you feel you got anything out of it?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I was not sure what I would get out of this. I was not sure i would
learn anything, I did not know what to expect. I liked we focused on the
testing, we have written a lot of code today. I really wanted to make that
image change but refactoring was going to help the next person</p>

<p>I think you guys know what you want out of it and have done well if what you
wanted to do is drive others to build the app for you then you have succeeded
but the app has a long way to go.</p>

<p><strong>Selena:</strong> Our goal this time was to have everyone involved to be part of
&ldquo;The Rail Camp Project&rdquo; and with the limited time to bring people around the
context we have had to drive it more then we would have liked to.</p>
