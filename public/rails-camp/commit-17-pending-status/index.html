<p>Bashir was another learning developer from Coder Academy and we spent some time
showing him the in&rsquo;s and out&rsquo;s of a tested rails app as part of our <a href="https://failure-driven.com/post/railscamp-pairing/">rails camp
Hobart</a> project. He got his hands on the
keyboard and implmented a spec but for him it was more about the exposure to
some new tools and approaches that seasoned developers take for granted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> how did yoy find it?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I liked it, there were quite a few things I didn&rsquo;t know, and you guys
helped me get through it. VIM and RSpec, I certainly need to learn those. Now
that I am somewhat familiar with them and I know how they can be used and
their power they are things I should look at.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> you are currently at Coder Academy, have they mentioned VIM or testing?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I know VIM wise, we were told not to use it at Coder Accademy. It was
shunned as too hard and unimportant. I think certainly there is some getting
used to it but you just showed me how powerfull it is and even with a few
initial commands you can get going.</p>

<p>RSpec testing wise we haven&rsquo;t done any testing yet, they leave that till
later part of the course, maybe we will use RSpec? I don&rsquo;t know. Certainly
what you showed me in testing seemed to make sense.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> what about the pairing?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I am often &ldquo;paired&rdquo; with my class mates, were we are using our own
computers, maybe sometimes using just one computer when working on a joint
rails project and we need to push changes from one computer via Git so the
other person can see the code. From what you have shown me that is not really
pairing.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> The idea is that collaboratively we come up with a better solution</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> yes it was intimidating at first, I suppose I didn&rsquo;t really know what
to expect and just learning I was worried I would not know enough, but I
warmed up to it.</p>

<p><strong>Selena:</strong> For us as professional programmers working with all levels of
programmers, even ones that have only started to learn to code, is benficial.
Working with your level or a seniour level it is always beneficial to work in
a pair as long as you put into it you will get things out of it.</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> And remember senior developers are intimidated sometimes as
well, they are just better at not showing it, we never know if we may make a
silly mistake, but often we will turn it around to be a learning moment and
you can not underestimate the life experience someone brings into a
particular problem domain, maybe the learning developer is an expert in the
problem space due to other work experience and they become a valuable part of
solving the problem. Thanks for your time</p>

<p><strong>Bashir:</strong> Thank you guys</p>
