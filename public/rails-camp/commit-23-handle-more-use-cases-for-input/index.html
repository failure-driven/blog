<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So Michael Morris, what is it that you do?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I am an Up banker, yeah a banker</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> You have submitted a talk to a national conference and been
successfull in being accepted, any tips?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Well it was an interesting topic, playing Mario Cart in ruby -
conference organiser bait - I can tell you more but will have to kill you.</p>

<p>This year round I have put in a talk around the stuff at work, there is a lot
of things around banking that are interesting but haven&rsquo;t been selected yet,
early days.</p>

<p>I suggest you focus on wht you want people to get out of that 40 mintues,
make it intersting for people.</p>

<p>And as for the submission, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like sales copy really&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> what do you think of &ldquo;The Rails Camp Project&rdquo; so far?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The code, well looks like, maybe I don&rsquo;t say :) The process on the
other hand is great, it is fantastic what you have done. The output of the
project is so much more than the code. Maybe you are solving the worlds
problems by sharing something in a different way</p>

<p><strong>Selena:</strong> You are right, our inspiration was all the missed opportunities
we see around at places like Rails Camp. Getting into software late myself I
would die for any opportunity to learn from all these knowledgeable people. I
see people missing out I want to change that by driving a fun project to get
people talking, sharing inspiring and learning. What have you seen in the
past that has inspired people to make more of opportunites to code and learn
together?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I have gone through different phases, some camps spending 12 hours a
day non stop coding. In the past I have written games for others to
participate in, I would happily help out, help other people.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> That&rsquo;s great, you know a lot of juniors come to these events, they
feel intimidated, sometimes it is up to us to seek out who needs some help, a
little direction, an interest in what they are doing, learning. Did you learn
anything today?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> [lauhgs] I have some thoughts of all the bad things with the code, but
you are not writing a banking app.</p>

<p>The process you guys are using is great! Write a project with a whole bunch
of people! The fact that is possilbe, te approach, the feeling of involvement
and community, that is a learning for me. Make sure you do it again sometime.</p>

<p>Ofcourse there is probably a lot of ways to solve the probelm of helping
others. Make sure you &ldquo;count me in next time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just remember You do You, do whatever you want ont his planet, you have 80
years, You do You, that is what everyone is good at doing.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you often pair program?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> There is one guy I work together with at work but not really pair.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think companies should do to bring in talent? Our thinking
at the moment is a full size velcro wall and velcro body suits!</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I don&rsquo;t think a velcro wall would encourage dversity, we have some
large people and that would not be fair</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What about our version of Continuous Integration (CI) alwasy working
and pushing to master?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> we do feature branches, master has to be shippable at all times, our
process requires for code review, we need a mechanism to do this, feature
branches and pull requests works for us. After all we have a bank to run,
lot&rsquo;s of security issues</p>
</blockquote>

<p>, github tooling &ldquo;we could make our code publick and it
wouldn&rsquo;t make a differencer
you have lots of oopprrtunities but ai is not</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> you mentioned your Werewolf alorithm to always be <del>lyn&hellip;</del> killing
has 340 stars?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> no the code does not have 340 stars, but during a game of Werewolf
people will beleive anything.</p>

<p>talking of which your idea for sp-uber, coming in 5 minutes, focus on that!</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> You had some interesting views on monliths and microservices?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> This is a rails camp and in my rails camp opinion that for any large
amount of code base I am a big fan of the monolith. When you want to add some
latency to your mehthod calls, that is when microservices are for you!</p>
