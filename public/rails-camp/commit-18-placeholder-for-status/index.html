<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> how did you find it? was it fun? interesting?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> It was great, I would definitely do it again. It was great to have
insights into features I have not seen before. Having the 2 of you guide me
through and being on hand to ask questions immediately was great, I found it
useful.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> so what do you think about pairing?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I was good with pair programming and I quite like it.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Did you learn anything new?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> There were a few things. I haven&rsquo;t done much Rails and I have just
moved onto doing some more Javascript learning as part of my Coder Academy
course. It is hard to learn a new thing when I have not really solidified my
knoweledge of Rails yet. In fact I am starting to forget some Rails. I didn&rsquo;t
know what you would get me to do. I was a little woried that I would go blank
but it all made sense in the end and your approach allowed me to easily bring
my former knowledge out and contribute.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> have you done any testing yet?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> pretty much none, no testing yet with Coder Accademy. I have used
<code>binding.pry</code> and it was cool how with it we could execute line by line and
work out why our test was not working. As far as testing goes, I have done
that all manually by clicking around up to this point.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> we can imagine from our own learning experiences that it is very hard
to write tests if you don&rsquo;t know yet know how to code all that much. It is
hard for us to write tests for certain things that we are not sure how they
will work, do you think you are at a level you can write some tests?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I had no idea how to write tests. Now that I have paired with Selena
and Michael I still have no idea how to wrte a test. I amsure the expereince
has helped and at some stage I will get the Aha moment and work it out</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>TODO</strong> what the fuck was this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, if I had to settle on smehtning that was interests&rdquo;</p>
