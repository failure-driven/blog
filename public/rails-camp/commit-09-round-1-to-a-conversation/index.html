<p>Pairing whilst coding is a lot about the social interaction. This next commit
of <a href="https://failure-driven.com/post/railscamp-pairing/">&ldquo;The Rails Camp Project&rdquo;</a> was less
about a test for Round 1 and more about the conversation. As with any Rails
Camp, it bring together Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers and everything they
are interested in. For Paul Doublas this means Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D).</p>

<p>Quick to grab the keyboard and write a relatively simple integration test
ensuring users end up on the first round of the game when they click the &ldquo;Start
Game&rdquo; button, Paul then had plenty of time to show off the D&amp;D figurines he
brought for the camp and tell us a little more about the game (since we&rsquo;re a
little naive when it comes to D&amp;D).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How did you find the experience pairing with us?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I enjoyed it, the pairing, seeing how you work but most of all how
we incorporated the figurines in the animated lolcommit gif at the end</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How familiar are you with pairing, TDD and working on master?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> There were a lot of new things here for me, I have never used RSpec
nor the React enzyme snapshot testing framework. I do some coding but it is
not the main part of my job. I write a lot of batch files. There is a lot of
stuff that you can do with batch files. There are things you would not expect
to be able to do with batch files.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you mostly do in your job?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Not so much web apps. Currently I am changing a client over from
Google Suite to Office 365. The reason is that government clients want data
soverenigty. They put everything in unencrypted emails but as long as it is
in Australia then it is OK</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong> Given all the technology and the various MMOs (massively
multiplayer online game) why is it that you choose to play D&amp;D without
computers?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I feel there is more freedom playing D&amp;D with a human as a backend,
as opposed to computer game play. It is like a &ldquo;mechanical turk&rdquo;. For example
in the layout we have here at Rails Camp there is a mountain that is not part
of the game play. If you wanted to climb the mountain in a computer game you
could not. The game is either programmed to allow this otherwise it is not
possible.  With a human moderated game, if players want to do something
outside of the game play, then they just ask the Dungeon Master (DM). The DM
can then determine the necessary skill, health and other parameters of the
task allowing the new task to be documented and included as a real time
expansion of the game. So all of a sudden a new quest is added to the game to
climb the mountain.</p>

<h3 id="next-time">Next time</h3>

<p>There is always a promise to a conversation when pairing with developers,
sharing experiences and learning new things. We hope you join us next time for
the conversation and the tidbits we lear as we build code. Till next time.</p>
