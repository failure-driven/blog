# RailsConf 2019 Minneapolis

It was super exciting to be selected to present a workshop at RailsConf 2019,
["Multi Layer BDD for Modern Rails Web
Apps"](https://railsconf.com/2019/schedule#wednesday) in Minneapolis!

In this session we ran through the ins and outs of testing modern web apps with
multi layer Behavioural Driven Development (BDD) making use of the latest
[Rails 6](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/6_0_release_notes.html) release.
