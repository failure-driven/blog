excerpt: "We had the pleasure of taking our pairing talk to Bangkok Thailand for the
second evern RubyConfTH. That talk received a lot of positive reaction and was a
good spot for attendees to put down their note taking utensils and just enjoy
the show, with cheers and jeers as the dramatisation hit home on a number of
topics."
