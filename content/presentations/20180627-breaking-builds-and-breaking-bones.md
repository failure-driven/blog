## Abstract

Becoming a software engineer or a professional kickboxer, you’ll run into many obstacles.

As a late-comer to coding, I learned about binary-hex translation and logic gates around 
3 months before I learned how to throw a punch. Now I’m a software engineer and a 
professional kickboxer. Both of which, surprisingly have a lot in common! 

This is my story about the struggles and celebrations of a two-year journey from 
alcohol-fuelled self-destruction to teaching myself how to write code, pursuing a career 
in software development and learning how to literally break other people’s bones. 

This is not a story sugar-coated with glorious moments of success every step of the way, 
but one of struggle, perseverance, and determination. 

Anyone following a dream, wanting to get into software, trying to change their career, 
just starting out or interested in hearing a story, prepare to be inspired & learn that 
failures will help you to ultimately succeed!
