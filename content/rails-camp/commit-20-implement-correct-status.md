### 5 minutes with Dana

> **Q:** how did you find the pairing? writing some React at Rails Camp?

> **A:** it was great, it refreshed my React skills. This will be good for my
> day job and side project.

> **Q:** what side projects are you working on?

> **A:** I am working on website using facial recognition technology to keep
> women safe on social media. The idea is you upload a picture and the picture
> is searched and returns any reports made against that person.

> **Selena:** Hopefully there are no reports on this person (looks at Michael),
> no but in all seriousness, what is the project called?

> **A:** The project name is InView **TODO** link to this?

> **Q:** any other side projects? what about your day job?

> **A:** I am currently working at Envato and also a contributor as part of the
> Cucumber team.

> **Q:** How did you find the pairing? do you do much pairing?

> **A:** Yeah it was good, I do a bit but I feel more pairing is needed at
> Envato. I am a very collaborative coder. Either pairing or rubber ducking, as
> in you are in a bath tub talking to your rubber duck, but you can do it with
> a co-worker as well, oh dear but that may lead to all sorts of
> different kinds of problems
