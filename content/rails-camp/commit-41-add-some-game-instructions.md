> **Q:** How did you find the experience?

> **A:** it was pretty good, you were good at explaining where the code was at
> and then likely next steps that needed to be done. This was great at this
> time of night to have so much support.

> I would have liked to sort out the other problem around the timer but maybe a
> bit hard at 3am and given it is javascript, and I am not a front end guy.

> **Selena:** Pat you claim not to be a front end guyt but you seem pretty good
> with the `p` tags :)

> **Pat:** this is my 4th react commit, of all time!

> **Selena:** are you a Rails Camp lifer?

> **Pat:** Ruby is my language of choice for 10 years. What has been the focus
> of this project for you guys?

> **Selena:** our project? purely from getting everyone involved and
> appreciating it is fantastic. You can only do so much, focus on so many
> things, getting almost everyone on camp to be involved has been an
> achivement. The lolcommit adds a lot of joy for every one involved

> **Pat:** Yeah every one had a great laugh at the joint commit and enjoyed it

> **Selena:** We have been light hearted as much as possible, the most serious
> part is the code commit message and the interview. We think everyone has
> learnt something.

> It has lead to lot's of discussions to help create more opportunities and
> more interactions with new and junior people.

> **A:** it was good fun, great, really thrilled you are doing this all!
