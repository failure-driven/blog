**TODO**

pretty good at explaining where code was at and next steps
great at this time of night to have something similar

would have liked to sort out initial problem around the timer but maybe a bit
har dat 3am

given it is javascript

SS claims to be a not front end guy but seem pretty good with the p tags

"this is my 4th react commit"

SS are you a rails camp lifer

Ruby is my lang of choice for 10 years.

our project - purely from getting everyone to appreciate it is fantastic -
you can only do so much focus on so many things - almost everyone on camp

the lolcommits adds a lot of joy for every one involved

every one had a great laygh at the joint commit and enjoy it

SS we have been light hearted most serious part is the code commit message nd
the interview

we think =every one has learnt something

lot's of discussions to help create more opportunities and more interactions
with new and junior people

it was good fun great, really thrilled you are doing this all
