**TODO**

We used to write full integration tests but now have split out to request
specs on the back end and frontend compnent tests

most people hated to write selenium specs

write request specs for things with consequences but maybe not for a plain
index controller that does nothing

the controller test that I write now usually test permission sets and things
like that.

the request spec test that assuming someone can do a thing that they can do it

only the happy path, don't test unauthorised

SS only on the happy path, how do you tst errros, how do you test the pretzel
that I have just half choked on

"we write code we expect to work" not the errors that may be surfaced

Team lead because bossy, acute concern about the care of others, so I
delegated to others, the pretzel

how have you found this exeperience: "it was fun" (soudned like fucked up)

probably going to make you sick, I touched your keyboard

I always wanted to do it

I like the cause, to get everyone to pair for a whole camp

Next rails camp I will find a junior and show me what your coding I am going
to do that - but move onto a conversation around what brought you here, the
person

SS - i am shit scared to show you my code, that is less likely to happen but
if you write some code you open that conversation and are more likely to have
  a real code conversation and get something done

  Lauren "I agree with that"

I had trouble, geniuenly understanding the state the app was in at the time I
came, likke that there was a backend

how the project progresses, people need more time to
