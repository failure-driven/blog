**TODO**

this has been a truley amazing rails camp for you guys

I spelt it right whtne I said itn

it is makcing sure everyone code
it has pairing
look at things they have not seen before
strongly encouraging people to step outside theri comfrot zone in a safe and
suportive environemengt

I guess I am interested to learn some more react

that is much less enthusisatic then i actually wash

this is bueatifyl

as a rails camp orginiser I would like to see more of tehse thinngs

having Mm & ss to be at all rails camps

by time you land in melbourne I would love you to get everyone but I don't
hink you will make it, sorry

I want you to make it, I don't think it will happen
thank you to your dedication to your coding at rails camp cause
