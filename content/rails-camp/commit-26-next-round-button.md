> **Q:** Caitlin, as one of the organisers of Rails Camp Hobart how have you
> found it?

> **A:** I will tell you one thing, this has been a truley amazing Rails Camp
> for you guys!

> - It is making sure everyone codes!

> - It has pairing

> It allows a lot of partipants look at things they have not seen before, be it
> testing, ReactJS, pairing. You are also strongly encouraging people to step
> outside their comfrot zone in a safe and suportive environment.

> **Q:** has it been a learning experience for yourself? what have inspired you
> to learn more of?

> **A:** I guess I am interested to learn some more react!

> **Q:** and "The Rails Camp Project" how have you found that?

> **A:** yeah good. That is much less enthusisatic then i actually feel, This
> project is beautiful. As a Rails Camp orginiser I would like to see more of
> these things. I think we need Michael and Selena to be at all the rails
> camps!

> **Q:** and the aim now is to code with everyone, it is 4pm on a Sunday, what
> are our chances?

> **A:** by time you land in Melbourne I would love you to get everyone in but
> I don't think you will make it, sorry :(

> Don't get me wrong, I want you to make it, I just don't think it will happen.
> Thank you to your dedication to your coding at Rails Camp because there is a
> lot more coding happening than at the last camp.

> 1 commit per participant per camp, that is a good minimum expectation to set!
