> **Q:** How did you find it?

> **A:** very fulfilling

> **Q:** it is now post breakfast on the Monday at the end of Rails Camp, are
> you happy we managed to fit you in?

> **A:** Yes, I wanted to be first, but it lived up to dreams, It was every
> thing I could have hoped for.

> **Q:** how were we to pair with?

> **A:** I was not made to feel uncomfortable like a newbie, you guided me very
> well through a lot of things I was new to.

> **Q:** did you learn anything?

> **A:** JSX is different even though very similar, RubyMine is cool, I tend to
> stick to more traditional editors.

> **Q:** any feedback for us?

> **A:** maybe consider pre-defined things at different levels of time,
> proficiency or experience. Give an option to do **A** in 10 minutes or **B**
> in 30 minutes depending on what the pair wants to learn or has specific
> knowledge on. Also give people the option to stretch out the paring session a
> little longer.

> **Q:** how did you find the pairing? do you pair much yourself?

> **A:** I don't pair much, and am not a huge fan. I am a massive control freak
> and like to drive. I do recognise importance of pairing as a learning tool.

> I have paired in an ad hoc way but not in a structured way.

> **Q:** any last thoughts?

> **A:** love it, need more coding and more talks at camp big thumbs up 👍

> **Q:** Where would you like this content posted at some stage?

> **A:** a forum post on [forum.ruby.org.au](https://forum.ruby.org.au/), and a
> blog post or something.
