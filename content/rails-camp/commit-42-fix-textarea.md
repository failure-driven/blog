**TODO**

how?
very fulfilling
wanted to be first
lived up to dreams
every thing I could have hoped for
was not made to feel uncomfortable like a newbie

jsx different even though similar
ruby mine is cool
I stick to more traditional editors

feedback
consider - pre defined things at different levels   do a in 10 min or b in 30
min with some specified knowledge
give people the option to stretch out longer

don't pair much - not a huge fan - massive control freak and like to drive.
recognise importance of pairing as a learning tool

have paired in ad hoc way but not in a structured way

thoughts on - love it more coding more talks at camp thumbs up

forum post - forum.ruby.org.au - and a blog post
