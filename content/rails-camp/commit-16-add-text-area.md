**TODO**

Up early on Sunday - have you written any code>? yes rails new on my event
sourcing app - pleas don't write this - perfecct

unfortunately I was in bed - how ddid you find the experieince - michael was
extermely good to pair with

great to pair with new poeple
emotianlly stresfull as you have to pick up body language as you are pairing -
pairing with new people is more stresfull, don't know their work flow

what the are comfortable with, how they like to be sopken too, really
concerend with other people how are you? I feel I am super easy to pair with,
but sometimes difficult if I am indecissive.

implemented the text area - michael gave me instructions - I didn't realise it
was collaborative effort the implementation waaas collaborative

I was given product requirement - I trust the peope around me and trust the
product managers

Need a certain level of "no that's a good idea"

Michael is trustworthy - you can write that one down

They can be confident but still go down the wrong path.

we struggled with the CSS - "Mornging is the perfeecct time to practive your
CSS (Countless Sex Styles)"

"I am not going to do that to you michael"

"severe category 6 creep vibe"

Hectiqu√© (with accent) pairing - aggressive no hold back - 7 hours straight
shooting shit, laughtin all day my abs hurt next day.
