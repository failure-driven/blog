It is tough getting up on a Sunday any week let alone at Rails Camp
let alone if you have had a long night the night before. There was a
moring bird around in Nadia and Michael so we sat down before breakfast
at [rails camp Hobart]({{< ref "/post/railscamp-pairing" >}}) for some coding
but left the commit till the complete triple was in place and Selena joined us.

By now we were in the rhythm of things and after a quick introduction to the
project on how we do BDD as integrations specs driving a browser and than
dropping down to UI component specs there were plenty of examples and code in
place to quickly help Nadia work out she needed a UI component test for the
text area which she wrote.

### 5 minutes with Nadia

> **Q:** You are up early on Sunday, have you written any code?

> **A:** Yes `rails new` on my event sourcing app, _please don't write this_,
> perfect

> **Selena:** unfortunately I was in bed, Michael is too keen to get started,
> how did you find the experieince

> **Nadia:** Michael was extermely good to pair with. It's always great to pair
> with new poeple. It can be emotionally stresfull as you have to pick up body
> language as you are pairing. Pairing with new people is more stresfull, you
> don't know their work flow what the are comfortable with, how they like to be
> spoken too.

> **Q:** You really seemed aware and concerned with other people you pair with,
> how are you to pair with do you think?

> **A:** I feel I am super easy to pair with, but sometimes difficult if I am
> indecissive.

> **Nadia:** We implemented the text area, Michael gave me clear instructions
> of how you are working and the aim of the project. I didn't realise it was a
> collaborative effort, that the implementation was collaborative. I was given
> the product requirement, I trust the peope around me and trust the product
> managers

> **Selena:** You still need a certain level of "no that's a good idea" or "how
> about we try this idea?"

> **Nadia:** Michael is trustworthy, you can write that one down!

> **Selena:** They can be confident but still go down the wrong path.

**TODO** what do we do here it is taking a bit of a turn??????


> **Michael:** we struggled with the CSS - "Morning is the perfect time to
> practice your CSS (Countless Sex Styles)"

> **Nadia:** I am not going to do that to you Michael

> **Selena:** this is at severe category 6 creep vibe

> **Nadia:** I am used to what we call HectiquÃ© (with accent) pairing -
> aggressive no hold back - 7 hours straight shooting shit, laughing all day my
> abs hurt next day.
