### 5 minutes with Laurence

> **Q:** how did you find it? was it fun? interesting?

> **A:** It was great, I would definitely do it again. It was great to have
> insights into features I have not seen before. Having the 2 of you guide me
> through and being on hand to ask questions immediately was great, I found it
> useful.

> **Q:** so what do you think about pairing?

> **A:** I was good with pair programming and I quite like it.

> **Q:** Did you learn anything new?

> **A:** There were a few things. I haven't done much Rails and I have just
> moved onto doing some more Javascript learning as part of my Coder Academy
> course. It is hard to learn a new thing when I have not really solidified my
> knoweledge of Rails yet. In fact I am starting to forget some Rails. I didn't
> know what you would get me to do. I was a little woried that I would go blank
> but it all made sense in the end and your approach allowed me to easily bring
> my former knowledge out and contribute.

> **Q:** have you done any testing yet?

> **A:** pretty much none, no testing yet with Coder Accademy. I have used
> `binding.pry` and it was cool how with it we could execute line by line and
> work out why our test was not working. As far as testing goes, I have done
> that all manually by clicking around up to this point.

> **Q:** we can imagine from our own learning experiences that it is very hard
> to write tests if you don't know yet know how to code all that much. It is
> hard for us to write tests for certain things that we are not sure how they
> will work, do you think you are at a level you can write some tests?

> **A:** I had no idea how to write tests. Now that I have paired with Selena
> and Michael I still have no idea how to wrte a test. I amsure the expereince
> has helped and at some stage I will get the Aha moment and work it out

**TODO** what the fuck was this?

> "Thank you, if I had to settle on smehtning that was interests"
