The whole point of our code with everyone at [rails camp Hobart]({{<
ref "/post/railscamp-pairing" >}}) project was to code with, well
everyone but sometimes you just need to stick it out with the core
team. 

We knew we would need to add React Router to be able to allow multipage navigation. We only knew that because we've done it before but even then it wasn't easy to understand all the moving parts. 

Helping someone else understand React Router and test drive it's implementation just sounded like a bit much at 9:30pm on a Saturday night, so we had to go this one as a duo.
