**TODO**

learnt lots of things like copy pasting form other projects, I am very
proficient please confirm on linked in


GOod skills on listening on right ear but not form left year

Trust collaboration

do you trust us
?
You know where I sleep?

have you been anticipating this moment? 2.45

Yeah if I went to bed would you wake me up?

we would have held your hand sleeping only ctrl c and v for cut paste

I love test first second and last, always test, dont write any code, the code
is the only thing to break the tests, the code is the problem delete the code
,dont write it, where are all the bugs? in the code?

where did you see bugs in test in production - exactly that is my point

feedback - no, don't type, delete that recording, no point it will go into the
notes
