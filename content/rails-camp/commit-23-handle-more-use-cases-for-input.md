**TODO**

Up banker

one time you submitted to do a talk to a national conference? got any tips? I
was. It was an interesting topic, playing mario cart in ruby - conference
organiser bait - I can tell yuo bit hvat to kill you. There is a lot of stuff
at work around banking that is interesting but haven't been selected yet,
earyl days

focus on wht you want people to get out of that 40 mintues make it int3ersting
for people.

"it's like sales copy rreally"

the code
looks like

the process i sgreat it is fantastic what you have done tne oputt of thep
rpocjet much more inmport ant then the code

maybe you are solving the wrold problem by sharing something in a different
way

SS craps on about all the opportunites she took but sees peopel missing out

I have gone through hpases spending 12 hours a day - in the past i have
written games for others to participate in - I would happliy helpp out with
other people

Juniors come to these events, they feel intimidated

did you learn anything?
lauhgs all the things bad with the code thoughts go through

the process you guys are using is great - write project with whole bunch of
people that is a learning for me - do it again sometime.

there is probably a lot of way sto solve prolbem of helping others.
"count me in next time"
"you do you, do whatver you wnat on this plante you have 80 years you do you"
one guy I work together but not really pair
"I don't think a velcro wall would encourage dversity, we have some large
people and that would not be fair"

we do feature branches, master has to be shippable all times, we need to code
review - we need a mechanism to do this. we have a bank to run, lot's of
security issues, github tooling "we could make our code publick and it
wouldn't make a differencer
you have lots of oopprrtunities but ai is not

no the code does not have 340 stars people will beleive anything

Spuber comming in 5 minutes - focus on that

"in my opinion, x amount of code base I am big fan of the monolith" when you
want to add latency to you rmehthod calls that is when microservices are for
you.
