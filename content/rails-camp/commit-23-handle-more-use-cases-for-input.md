> **Q:** So Michael Morris, what is it that you do?

> **A:** I am an Up banker, yeah a banker

> **Q:** You have submitted a talk to a national conference and been
> successfull in being accepted, any tips?

> **A:** Well it was an interesting topic, playing Mario Cart in ruby -
> conference organiser bait - I can tell you more but will have to kill you.

> This year round I have put in a talk around the stuff at work, there is a lot
> of things around banking that are interesting but haven't been selected yet,
> early days.

> I suggest you focus on wht you want people to get out of that 40 mintues,
> make it intersting for people.

> And as for the submission, "it's like sales copy really"

> **Q:** what do you think of "The Rails Camp Project" so far?

> **A:** The code, well looks like, maybe I don't say :) The process on the
> other hand is great, it is fantastic what you have done. The output of the
> project is so much more than the code. Maybe you are solving the worlds
> problems by sharing something in a different way

> **Selena:** You are right, our inspiration was all the missed opportunities
> we see around at places like Rails Camp. Getting into software late myself I
> would die for any opportunity to learn from all these knowledgeable people. I
> see people missing out I want to change that by driving a fun project to get
> people talking, sharing inspiring and learning. What have you seen in the
> past that has inspired people to make more of opportunites to code and learn
> together?

> **A:** I have gone through different phases, some camps spending 12 hours a
> day non stop coding. In the past I have written games for others to
> participate in, I would happily help out, help other people.

> **Q:** That's great, you know a lot of juniors come to these events, they
> feel intimidated, sometimes it is up to us to seek out who needs some help, a
> little direction, an interest in what they are doing, learning. Did you learn
> anything today?

> **A:** [lauhgs] I have some thoughts of all the bad things with the code, but
> you are not writing a banking app.

> The process you guys are using is great! Write a project with a whole bunch
> of people! The fact that is possilbe, te approach, the feeling of involvement
> and community, that is a learning for me. Make sure you do it again sometime.

> Ofcourse there is probably a lot of ways to solve the probelm of helping
> others. Make sure you "count me in next time!"

> Just remember You do You, do whatever you want ont his planet, you have 80
> years, You do You, that is what everyone is good at doing.

> **Q:** Do you often pair program?

> **A:** There is one guy I work together with at work but not really pair.

> **Q:** What do you think companies should do to bring in talent? Our thinking
> at the moment is a full size velcro wall and velcro body suits!

> **A:** I don't think a velcro wall would encourage dversity, we have some
> large people and that would not be fair

> **Q:** What about our version of Continuous Integration (CI) alwasy working
> and pushing to master?

> **A:** we do feature branches, master has to be shippable at all times, our
> process requires for code review, we need a mechanism to do this, feature
> branches and pull requests works for us. After all we have a bank to run,
> lot's of security issues

, github tooling "we could make our code publick and it
wouldn't make a differencer
you have lots of oopprrtunities but ai is not

> **Q:** you mentioned your Werewolf alorithm to always be ~~lyn...~~ killing
> has 340 stars?

> **A:** no the code does not have 340 stars, but during a game of Werewolf
> people will beleive anything.

> talking of which your idea for sp-uber, coming in 5 minutes, focus on that!

> **Q:** You had some interesting views on monliths and microservices?

> **A:** This is a rails camp and in my rails camp opinion that for any large
> amount of code base I am a big fan of the monolith. When you want to add some
> latency to your mehthod calls, that is when microservices are for you!
