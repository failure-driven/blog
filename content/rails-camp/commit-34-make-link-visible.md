> **Q:** how was the experience?

> **A:** it was horrible! leading up to it I couldn't imagine a worse time but
> I was overreacting I think. As you guys are so keen to get everyone envolved
> it felt a little forced and I don't like anything being enforced.

> **Q:** did you find it intimidating?

> **A:** it wasn't intimidating, maybe just a small bit, it was ok! I now feel
> much better having done it.

> **Selena:** we are really happy you did a commit with us, We just really
> wanted everyone to have the chance to write some code with us this Rails
> Camp. I feel people at Rails Camp often miss opportunities and there is so
> much experience in this room, sometimes people need a little bit of
> encouragement.

> **Caroline:** you also need to be concious of what peole want. Now having
> done it I am really happy having done it and it was good.

> **Q:** did you learn anything?

> **A:** interesting that not everyone uses aliases, as you guys don't. Also
> the co-authored commits are cool.
