**TODO**

it was horrible

I couldn't imagein a worse time I was being an idiot

react to the felling forces

this morning "hey you are up for doing this monring"

don't like anything being enforced.


wasn't intimidating, just a small bit it was ok

I now feel awful

we are really happy you do a commit - and we really wanted everyone to write
code

SS = feel people at rails camp have missed opportunities and there is so much
experience.

Caaroline need to be concious of what peole want

Now having done it I am really happy having done it and it was good.

did you learn anything - aliases not everyone,
