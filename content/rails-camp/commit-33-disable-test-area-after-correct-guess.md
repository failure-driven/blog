> **Q:** so was this the best thing at camp?

> **A:** No, not the hightlight of the camp, playing werewolf was the highlight
> where I was dealt the seer card three times in one camp in one night! that is
> hard to beat!

> **Q:** how did you find the expereince?

> **A:** intimidating as I didn't know what you had roped me in for. I would do
> it again though!

> **Q:** any tips for us?

> **A:** I think there is too much react stuff going on and it takes time to
> make sense of it as well. I hate the idea of two people watching me code.

> **Q:** do you pair program much?

> **A:** sometimes I pair program, I like a balance, some pairing but not too
> much. I might work with someone for a bit but I don't want to think I am
> wasting someone elses time

> **Q:** but it was a priveledge to code with you, you need to share your
> coding time with others!

> **A:** sometime I need some time to think about things, do some isolated
> experiments and I prefer to do that solo. Pairing takes extra effort to
> communicate everything as you are going along which is fine but sometimes it
> is nice to find out some things solo and bring them back to the problem.

> **Q:** are you into Test Driven Development (TDD)?

> **A:** Testing yes, not necessarily testing first. What we did today, would
> be a good example where we could not do test first as we were unfamiliar with
> some things - it is ok to do some tinkering with the browser.
