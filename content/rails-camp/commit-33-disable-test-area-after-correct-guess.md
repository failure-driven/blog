**TODO**

not the hightlight of the camp, playing werewoolf - dealt the seer card 3
times in 1 camp in 1 night

intimidating as I didn't know what you had roped me infor

I would do it again though

I think there is too much react stuff I make sense of

I hate 2 people watching me code

sometimes pair program

I like a balance, some pairing but not too much work with someone for a bit
but don't want to think I am wasting someone elses time

SS but it's a priveleege to code with you

sometime I need some time to think agbout it, do some isolated experiments and
prefer to do that solo

pairing takes extra effort to communicat everything as you are going along
which is fine but sometime ti is nice to find some things solo and bring it
back to the problem

Testing yes not necessarily testing first.

this would be a good example where we could not do test first as we were
unfamiliar with some things - it is ok to do some tinkering with the browser.
