By the time we caught up with Nick for our [rails camp Hobart]({{< ref
"/post/railscamp-pairing" >}}) code with everyone project it was more like hime
tracking us down for a final commit in the wee hours of Satruday morning. The
setup was the same, show him the app so far, the Integratoin specs and the
React component tests. Then it is time to get his hands on the keyboard and
drive our pair or tripple to implement the next step. In this case he wrote a
pending spec for a text area to guess what is in the image that is dispalyed.

### 5 minutes with Nick

> **Q:** how did you find the pairing?

> **A:** this is a really cool project! I have heard the start of the story
> about people not writing too much code last rails camp. The thing is how do
> you do it in a way that is not too forcing of people, keep them comfortable,
> encorage them, make them want to be part of it and that is what you have made
> happen! We all want to be part of it now, the Rails Camp Hobart Project, we
> are hanging out just to take our turn, look at me it is half past two in the
> morining, this is so cool. 

> **Q:** why thank you, have you learnt anything from the experience?

> **A:** why yes, this is the first time I have written pending RSpec specs. I
> did hear about them, hmm let me think, at a talk a few weeks ago, at the
> [Ruby Meetup]({{< ref "/presentations/20181031-failing-for-the-right-reason" >}}),
> I think it was the most informative and enterataining talk, probably
> the most entertaining talk ever!

> Also the last bit were we write the Git commit message in your default editor
> that happens to be VI. A bit of VI was something I have not looked into as
> yet.

> **Selena:** The secret with VI is to repeat anything you learn and keep
> repeating. Also it is good to have someone there to help you and remind you.
> In this case I was able to tell you the key strokes as I have heard it over
> and over again today

> **Q:** anything else you have learnt?

> **A:** Your test first apporach is definitely the way it should be done but
> my current industry experience is app first and tests maybe later. The
> enthusiasim for TDD varies greatly from developer to devleoper. In my mind
> Test driving is a way to faster success. If you build your app without a
> reliable test suite, every time you need to change, you cannot quickly
> confirm that it still works. If you don't have a reliable test suite you have
> no confidence of what the flow on effects of your change could be.

> It was good you just got me here. Your ambition to get every one to write
> some code, your eagerness to adjust to the skill set of the people you are
> pairing with, you manage to build good culture very quickly.
