By the time we caught up with Nick to help us with our [rails camp Hobart]({{< ref
"/post/railscamp-pairing" >}}) project, it was more like him tracking us down for a final commit in the wee hours of Sunday morning. 

Same as we'd been practising all day, we showed him the app so far - the Integratoin specs and the React component tests - before getting his hands on the keyboard and drive forward with the next step. 

We don't have a whole lot to say 'cause we were pretty wrecked by that time but Nick wrote the next pending spec for a text area to guess what is in the image that is dispalyed.

### 5 minutes with Nick

> **Q:** How did you find the pairing?

> **A:** This is a really cool project! I have heard the start of the story
> about people not writing too much code last rails camp. The thing is, how do
> you do it in a way that is not too forcing of people, keep them comfortable,
> encorage them, make them want to be part of it and that is what you have made
> happen! We all want to be part of it now, the Rails Camp Hobart Project, we
> are hanging out just to take our turn, look at me it is half past two in the
> morining, this is so cool. 

> **Q:** Have you learnt anything from the experience?

> **A:** Why yes, this is the first time I have written pending RSpec specs. I
> did hear about them, hmm let me think, at a talk a few weeks ago, at the
> [Ruby Meetup]({{< ref "/presentations/20181031-failing-for-the-right-reason" >}}),
> I think it was the most informative and enterataining talk, probably
> the most entertaining talk ever!

> Also the last bit were we wrote the Git commit message in your default editor
> that happens to be VI. A bit of VI was something I have not looked into as
> yet.

> **Selena:** The secret with VI is to repeat anything you learn and keep
> repeating. Also it is good to have someone there to help you and remind you.
> I was able to tell you the key strokes we needed to write (which I also learned today)
> because I've heard it over and over with everyone we've worked with on the project so
> far.

> **Q:** Anything else you have learnt?

> **A:** Your test first apporach is definitely the way it should be done but
> my current industry experience is app first and tests maybe later. The
> enthusiasim for TDD varies greatly from developer to devleoper. In my mind
> Test driving is a way to faster success. If you build your app without a
> reliable test suite, every time you need to change, you cannot quickly
> confirm that it still works. If you don't have a reliable test suite you have
> no confidence of what the flow on effects of your change could be.

> Your ambition to get every one to write some code, your eagerness to adjust to the
> skill set of the people you are pairing with, you manage to build good culture very
> quickly.
