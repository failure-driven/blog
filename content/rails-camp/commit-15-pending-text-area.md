**TODO**

"this is a really cool project"

I have heard the start of the story about people not writing code last rails
camp

this is the first time I have written pending rspec - at a talk a few weeks
ago, informative and enterataining, probably the most entertaining talk ever

a bit of VI that was something I have not looked into as yet.

Selena : repeat and have someone there to help you and remind you I was able
to tell you the key strokes as I have heard it over and over again today

Your test first apporach is definitely the way it should be done but my
current industry experience is app first and tests maybe later. The
enthusiasim for TDD varies greatly developer to devleoper. In my mind Test
driving is a way to faster success. If you build your app without a reliable
test suite, every time you need to change, you cannot quickly confirm. if you
don't have  areliable test suite you have no confidence that flow on effect
could be done.

it was good you just got me here. Your ambision to get every one to write osme
code. your eagerness to adjust to the skill set of the popell good culture
building.
