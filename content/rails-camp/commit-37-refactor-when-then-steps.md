> **Q:** how did you find it?

> **A:** I was super keen to join you guys, I knew I have not done this before
> so it was exciting to be taken on this quick tour. I have not worked with
> Given/When/Then testing stuff in this way. Most recently I have been writing
> in elixir and thought this would be fun.

> **Q:** do you think you learnt anything today?

> **A:** what I learnt was the process, step by step. I am used to testing more
> on the backend and no so much on frontend also more at the isolated unit test
> level and not this idea of steps flowing through the whole system. I haven't
> done flow testing, but at the end of the day it's still an integration test

> **Q:** what were your expectations of this pairing experience?

> **A:** it was an interesting situation because it was all setup and I felt
> there were expectations on me to do things a certain way and do something in
> paritcular, I was not sure what to do, which direction to drive it in but you
> guys manage to keep me guided on the path you were aiming for.

> **Q:** how do you think we managed that?

> **A:** I liked the playfull time, it was fun! I can't figure Selena out, you
> can put that on the record, it was certainly a good time.

> **Q:** anything we can do better?

> **A:** I would do it agian, but maybe Michael can also wear a stripy shirt
> next time?

> **Q:** do you feel you got anything out of it?

> **A:** I was not sure what I would get out of this. I was not sure i would
> learn anything, I did not know what to expect. I liked we focused on the
> testing, we have written a lot of code today. I really wanted to make that
> image change but refactoring was going to help the next person

> I think you guys know what you want out of it and have done well if what you
> wanted to do is drive others to build the app for you then you have succeeded
> but the app has a long way to go.

> **Selena:** Our goal this time was to have everyone involved to be part of
> "The Rail Camp Project" and with the limited time to bring people around the
> context we have had to drive it more then we would have liked to.
