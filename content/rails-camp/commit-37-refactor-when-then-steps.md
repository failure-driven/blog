**TODO**

Super keen to join you guys,
I knew I hae not done this before
not worked with When/Then stuff and in this way
have been writing in elixir
and thought this would be fun

what I learnt was the process,step by step
I am used to testing more on the b/e and no so much on f/e
more at unit tests and not step by step

I haven't done flow testing
At the end of the day still anintegration test

Interestin situation because it was all setup and I felt there was
expectations on me to do things a cretain way and do something in paritcular,
I was not sure what to do

I liked the playfull time, it was fine
I can't figure Selena out, put that on the record
it was a good time, I would do it agian, maybe Michael can also wear a stripy
shirt

I was not sure what I would get out of this. I was not sure i would learn
anything, I did not know what to esxpect.

I liked we foccused on the testing, we have written a lot

I really wanted to make that image change but refactoring was going to help
the next person

I think you guys know what you want out of it and have done well
if what you wanted to do is drive others to build the app for you then you
have succeeded but the app has a long way to go

Our goal this time was to have everyone invoolved to be part of the project
the limited time to bring people around the context we have had to drive it
more
