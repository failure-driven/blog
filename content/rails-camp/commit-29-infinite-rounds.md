**TODO**

> **Q:** Geoff you are an Ember developer, how did you find today's experience?

> **A:** I feel like the last 5 years of my life have been wasted (re react vs
> ember). I have been wanting to create a react app to play with and someone to
> guide me thorugh it is great.

> I know the benefits of react but also see some pain points that would get on
> my nerves, things like snapshots, still not confinced, sceptical.

> I use tests to write components, the test builds it for me as I look at the
> tests it helps me write the compnent. As for snapshots, maybe for designers,
> but if the snapshot is goint to break each time I change something I don't
> want to have to blindly just click yeah, yeah, nah, yeak it changed as
> expected or not.

> I don't want to bad mouth it till I use it with intent, maybe you have
> inspired me to try it out.

> **Q:** Have you used RubyMine before?

> **A:** Yes, I have used RubyMine but now I mostly use VSCode but use the Vim
> emulater.

> **Q:** and what do you think about the broader "The Rails Camp Project" ?

> **A:** It is fantastic, it gives everyone a chance to experience pairing and
> get something to happen. and give everyone the experinece. There is a lot of
> effort in this. Well done guys!

> **Q:** any suggestions for next time?

> **A:** maybe next time a Rails EmberJS app for people to contribute to?

> **Q:** do you feel you learnt something?

> **A:** I have learnt and want to learn some more. I want to dig into the
> router a bit more, you get it for free in ember, the router works so you just
> need to test the routes.

> **Q:** Ember vs React, we are finding it hard to find people who know ember
> to hire?

> **A:** It may be hard to find enough people in Australia but you maybe need
> less Ember devs than React so the Ember ones are more scarce?

> **Q:** any tips for us?

> **A:** Only this one. [pointing at Selan] she is fun! [noding at Michael] he
> is intimidating.

> **Q:** do you pair much in your day job?

> **A:** We pair a fair bit at [two red kites](https://tworedkites.com/). I use
> pairing to help most of my team not the rest of the team because the rest of
> the team is the boss Nigel.

> **Q:** how have you found "The Rails Camp Project" ?

> **A:** Good use of a Rails Camp to have an organised way of getting beginners
> more up to speed and get them to play with code, this should be a core focus
> of Rails Camp and you guys nailed it.

> Thank you, thank you for doing it!
