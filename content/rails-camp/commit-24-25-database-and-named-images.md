> **Q:** so how did you find the pairing and testing as part of "The Rails Camp
> Project" ?

> **A:** It was fun, I would do it again, maybe appart from lolcommits. It was
> fun to disccover where the exercise as a whole is up to and what you wanted
> me to configure.

> **Q:** did you learn anything?

> **A:** Yeah I learnt that RubyMine can enalble vim bindings, that is pretty cool.

> **Q:** do you pair in your day job?

> **A:** I am pairing every now and again, mostly in the context of helping a
> junior. Most of my pairing is also remote, remote pairing is, let's just say interesting.

> **Q:** What technology do you use for remote pairing?

> **A:** Usually in a video conferencing app like a zoom session and the pair
> will share their screen and I just guide them. I feel it an unnecssary
> sophistication to use a more complex tool to both collaborate. I feel it is
> one extra thing that is not helpfull enough to make it worthwhile.

> I do like the paring style where one person drives and the other is
> navigating and switch once enough code has been written to commit, I enjoy
> that but have not had the opportunity recenty to do that style of pairing.

> **Q:** what tools have you used in the past to do collabrative pairing?

> **A:** I have used tmux and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) before as tools which
> allow to share terminals and dev servers whilst minimising bandwidth by not
> having to send any video.

> **Q:** Having seen the code, had the pairing experience with us, what do you
> think of "The Rails Camp Project" ?

> **A:** I think it is a fantastic initiative, probably one of the best things
> I have seen at any rails camp out of the 19 I have been at! Your project
> ticks so many boxes, collaborating with so many people, every collaboration
> is a different pairing experience. It was relatively non threating, with you
> guys guiding each participant it was hard not to want to take part, and fun
> with the lolcommit.

> Why what opinions have you formed?

> **Selena:** it is now a real project with some momentum. We are wandering how
> we can scale this in the future?

> **Keith:** look your last participant, Michael Morris is now helping juniors,
> I think you have inspired him.
