**TODO**

It was fun, I would do it again
appart from lolcommits - disccover where the exercise as a whole is up to and
what you wanted me to configure

Learnt that RubyMine can enalble vim bindings that is pretty cool

pairing every now and again, contesxt of helping a junior. Remote pairing is
interesting. Usually in zoom session and pair will share their screen and I
jsut guide them.

unnecssary sophistication to use a more complex tool to both collaborate - one
extra thing that is not helfull enought to make it worthwhilte

I do like the pariing style where 1 drive and the other is navigating and
swithc once enought to commit, enjoy that but have not had the opportunity
recenty to do that

tmux and grok before as tools to minise bandwidth problesm.

fantastich initaiatve one of the best tjhings I have seen at any rails camp
out of the 19 I have been at

ticks so many boxes, collaborating with so many people, every collaboration is
a different pairing experience. relatively non threating, and fun with the
lolcommit.

What opinions have you formed? -
it is now a projcect how can we scale this in the future - Micahel is now
helping juniors.
