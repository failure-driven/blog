**TODO**

on the back seat with mm & ss

experience - 4th rails camp - 2011 first one

the pairing - it was good fast, had to go for something I was familiar

quick overview of testing which I never really have done - good to get an
overview

Design experience - pro tips? come back and think about what you are tyring
people to do, what is the aim of the game, what are you trying to achieve how
are you going to communicate it is wrong/right people should be able to guess
the name of the werewolf without any help

who is the person on rails camp

work out what you want people to get out of the game -

30 min pairing - that would be terrible - need to get context -

sort of (trying to avoid us?) laughter

being able to show something and we made this is good outside of just the
project
