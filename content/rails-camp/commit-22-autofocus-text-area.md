### 5 minutes with James

> **Q:** how was the exeprience? You jokingly mentioned we were going to bully
> you into taking part at some stage, what was the level of bullying?

> **A:** You see I am not usaully a pair programmer. It's been a while. I
> mostly do spikes here and there, I think I am a bit of a cowboy coder. I
> amnot like straight on the server or anything, but yeah I have done plenty of
> that in my time

> **Q:** so what kind of coding do you do in your role? do you test drive much?

> **A:** I have the luxury of not performing all the correct TDD (Test Driven
> Development) things, I suppose you guys are looking at me as if that is not a
> luxury but some kind of disease. I think the value of tests come from having
> valuable tests, I do a lot of code prototyping, seeing how things work and if
> you value speed to see how things works to be able to feed into an
> implemetation later on. A spike concept does not need tests. I help break
> down the problem for feasability.

> **Q:** do you every pair or test?

> **A:** when we build properly we will test and even mob program but not test
> first, not the way I like it. You can write the code first you know.

> **Selena:** You can totaly drive your development through your tests first.

> **A:** I feel it slows me down a frustrating amount. I am in a position that
> I can get away with it, working on the edges of the business and not the
> essential core of the business

> **Q:** You are not a test first guy?

> **A:** Not a test first guy, never have been never will be not a pair
> programmer

> **Q:** This experience has not changed you? You had a terrible time?

> [silence]

> **A:** not a terrible time but I was forced into this situation. Look I do
> see the value.

> **Q:** would you enforce testing at work?

> **A:** I don't enforce TDD but definitye stuff should be covered with
> testing. My mehthod of working is very ADD Not much time to focus on pair
> programming kind of work. I find pair programing frustrating.

> **Q:** How do you get your team to work the way you want them to work?

> **A:** I work at higher architercture level. How thing integrate together
> that kind of thing.

**TODO** continue from here on

product: Harbour what AWS env looks like
"put it this wway I have a lot of access to a lot of pepoles envoirments"

about discovering thoose services hmans ae good at anomoly detection
"kind fo massive giant spot the difference"

visualise and diagnoes network and security

I got out of it "Iam correct testing is not for me, not my style"

I started in basic and C - there was not much in terms of testing then

growning up with the development of internet technologies was so easy, but
these days there are som many things to know and where these concpets,
technologies, netowrk libarries and where they came from

Boot camps - thoughts? I have seen good results from people
it covers you don't know what hyou don't know if you want to go down this
bpath this is the package of the things you need to know

to become dev technoloigist you need to be a patrticular type of person

but a lot of people get passion ignite and then keep on top of it and move
forward

" you got me to do something I didn't want to do wtih great success"
