**TODO**

how was the exeprience? what was the level of bullying

I am not usaully a pari programmer - been a while . I do spikes here and
there, cowboy coder, not straight on the server but I have doen pelenty of
that in my time

I have the luxury of not performing all the correct TDD things
The value of tests come from having valuable tests, a lot of code
prototytpeing and seeing how things work and if you speed to see how it works
to impoment later on a spiek concept does not need tests. break probelm down
for feasability

when build propery test and mob

but not first, not the way I like it.

you can write code first

SS you wan tot drive your development throght tests
it slows me down a frustrating amount I am in a position that I can get away
with it, working on the edges not the essential core of the business

Not a test first never have been never will be not a pair programmer

you have not changed

You had a terrible time <silence> not a terrible time but forced into
situations
I see the value

I don't enforce TDD but definitye stuff should be covered with testing
my mehthod of working is very ADD
not much time to focus on pair programming kind of work
I find pair programing frustrated

How do you get your team to work the way you want them to work
I work at higher architercture level

how thing integrate

product: Harbour what AWS env looks like
"put it this wway I have a lot of access to a lot of pepoles envoirments"

about discovering thoose services hmans ae good at anomoly detection
"kind fo massive giant spot the difference"

visualise and diagnoes network and security

I got out of it "Iam correct testing is not for me, not my style"

I started in basic and C - there was not much in terms of testing then

growning up with the development of internet technologies was so easy, but
these days there are som many things to know and where these concpets,
technologies, netowrk libarries and where they came from

Boot camps - thoughts? I have seen good results from people
it covers you don't know what hyou don't know if you want to go down this
bpath this is the package of the things you need to know

to become dev technoloigist you need to be a patrticular type of person

but a lot of people get passion ignite and then keep on top of it and move
forward

" you got me to do something I didn't want to do wtih great success"
