Bashir was another learning developer from Coder Academy and we spent some time
showing him the in's and out's of a tested rails app as part of our [rails camp
Hobart]({{< ref "/post/railscamp-pairing" >}}) project. He got his hands on the
keyboard and implmented a spec but for him it was more about the exposure to
some new tools and approaches that seasoned developers take for granted.

### 5 min with Bashir

> **Q:** how did yoy find it?

> **A:** I liked it, there were quite a few things I didn't know, and you guys
> helped me get through it. VIM and RSpec, I certainly need to learn those. Now
> that I am somewhat familiar with them and I know how they can be used and
> their power they are things I should look at.

> **Q:** you are currently at Coder Academy, have they mentioned VIM or testing?

> **A:** I know VIM wise, we were told not to use it at Coder Accademy. It was
> shunned as too hard and unimportant. I think certainly there is some getting
> used to it but you just showed me how powerfull it is and even with a few
> initial commands you can get going.

> RSpec testing wise we haven't done any testing yet, they leave that till
> later part of the course, maybe we will use RSpec? I don't know. Certainly
> what you showed me in testing seemed to make sense.

> **Q:** what about the pairing?

> **A:** I am often "paired" with my class mates, were we are using our own
> computers, maybe sometimes using just one computer when working on a joint
> rails project and we need to push changes from one computer via Git so the
> other person can see the code. From what you have shown me that is not really
> pairing.

> **Q:** The idea is that collaboratively we come up with a better solution

> **A:** yes it was intimidating at first, I suppose I didn't really know what
> to expect and just learning I was worried I would not know enough, but I
> warmed up to it.

> **Selena:** For us as professional programmers working with all levels of
> programmers, even ones that have only started to learn to code, is benficial.
> Working with your level or a seniour level it is always beneficial to work in
> a pair as long as you put into it you will get things out of it.

> **Michael:** And remember senior developers are intimidated sometimes as
> well, they are just better at not showing it, we never know if we may make a
> silly mistake, but often we will turn it around to be a learning moment and
> you can not underestimate the life experience someone brings into a
> particular problem domain, maybe the learning developer is an expert in the
> problem space due to other work experience and they become a valuable part of
> solving the problem. Thanks for your time

> **Bashir:** Thank you guys
