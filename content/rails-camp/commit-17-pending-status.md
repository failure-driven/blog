how did yoy find it?

I liked it, few things I didn't know, you guys helped me through

VIM and rspec certainly neeed to learn those, get familiar now that I know of
it
VIM wise - we were told not to use it at Coder Accademy - it was shunned
RSpec testing wise we haven't done any testing

pairing - I ampaird with class mates, both own cmputer sometimes one computer
when working on rails project pushed changes - but not really pairing
collaboratively we come upp with a better solution
yes it was intimidating - but I warmed up to it
working with your level is beneficial too as well as with seniours
remember seniors are also intimidated if we make mistakes
"thank you guys"
