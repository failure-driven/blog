**TODO**

It was great, the lol commits definitely the highlight

I loved intese focus to do 1 thing and do it in such a short time. I learnt
shit tuns $ for end of regex I learnt I don't know stuff

React - a little

"your react looks great, are you doing it all wrong?

I learnt I can drill into snapshots never you you can look at them

RSpec

I a pro test and test it allows me to structure what is happening
only have done it post as I am not experienced eenought

I often write tests but don't build it, at lookahead as a tactical recuirter

and changeineers build medical shit

Watching it build and having 2 people look at you coding is intense
"You sound like you know hwat you are doing, kudos"

I would have loved to be a fly on the wall and watched this

"you are both good at predicting difficult moments and catching failures to
reduce the intimidation

not as intimidating as I thought it would be after watching you pair with
others.
