> **Q:** how was it?

> **A:** It was great, the lolcommit is definitely the highlight!

> I loved the intense focus to do one thing and do it in such a short time. I
> learnt shit tons. Even little things like `$` for end of line being the same
> for regex as well as a shortcut in Vim. I learnt I don't know stuff

> **Q:** have you ever done any react?

> **A:** React - a little

**TODO** what is this quote?

"your react looks great, are you doing it all wrong?

> **Q:** did you learn anything in React?

> **A:** I learnt I can drill into snapshots, never knew you can actually open
> up the file and look at them.

> **Q:** what about testing using RSpec?

> **A:** I am pro test and test first looks like it allows me to structure what
> is happening up front. In practice I have only done testing post
> implementation, I felt I was not expereinced enough.

> **Q:** do you do much coding and/or testing day to day?

> **A:** I often write tests but don't build much as I am a tactical recuirter
> at [Lookahead](https://www.lookahead.com.au/)

> **Q:** so where do you get most of your coding done?

> **A:** I work with [Changeineers](https://changineers.com.au/) and build
> medical shit!

> **Q:** how was the experience pairing with us?

> **A:** Watching this project build over the last day and a half and
> anticipating having 2 people look over my sholder as I do some coding started
> to feel really intese. But you sound like you know what you are doing and
> guided me throught it well, kudos to you!"

> I would have loved to be a fly on the wall and watched all your interactions
> pairing. You are both good at predicting difficult moments and catcing
> failures to reduce any moments of embarassement or intimidation.

> **Q:** were you intimidated?

> **A:** not as intimidating as I thought it would be after watching you pair
> with others.
