### 5 minutes with Erin

> **Q:** how did you find the experience? the pairing?

> **A:** It was really fun, I loved that you guys held my hand a bit. You made
> it accessbile for me to be part of it to be actually writing the code. You
> managed to teach me very quickly what I needed to do. It was as if we ended
> up just playing with all these testing frameworks and git commits.

> **Q:** and what do you do for a day job?

> **A:** I just started at Marketplacer

> **Q:** did you learn anything? any takeaways?

> **A:** it was cool to get more exposure to these things

> **Q:**

> **A:** I didn't really know what to expect. I certainly would never come up
> to you and ask to pair.

> **Q:** really? why did you come to rails camp? what were you hoping to get
> out of it?

> **A:** I thought it would be good for me, great to hang with coders, and now
> I know I can just go up to people and ask for a pair, ask for help, it has
> changed my outlook on Rails Camp. Still I am not sure if I would be able to
> just ask someone to code with me. I am good if people introduce me, but to
> introduce myself?

> **Q:** do you have any feedback for us?

> **A:** initially I felt a little bit intimidated, two expereinced developers
> just coming up to me and starting a conversation, not only that but getting
> me to code whilst they look over my shoulder, but I suppose that was only at
> the beginning, did I do well?

> **Q:** We think you did just fine, Erin you are very polite, Wow did we
> almost miss lunch?

**TODO** not sure how best to finish this off

> **Erin:** Yeak I think we better eat now.
