**TODO**

It was really fun - Iloved that you guys held my hand a bit
you made it accessbile for me for what you were teaching

played with all these testing frameworks and git commits

just started at Marketplacer

it was cool to get more exposure to these things

didn't know  what to expecat
would never come up toyou and ask to pair - really? why did yuo com tom rails
camp? - it would be good for me, great to hang with coders,

I am not so sure enough to just ask to code - I am good if people introduce
me.

feedback for us - a little bit intimedating "I thinnnnnk your fine" "Erin is
very polite"

I think the rest of us can eat now
