> **Q:** how did you find the experience?

> **A:** well I stayed up waiting for my go, it is now almost 2am Monday
> morning. I liked the concept of everyone from Rails Camp collaborating on one
> project and the git commit history is nice way of connecting everyone.

> **Q:** do you think we are ready to launch? with the app we have built so
> far?

> **A:** I think you can go to market even though I did not expect it to work
> the way it did - I needed more guidance in actually playing the game.

> **Q:** We didn't want to get in too deep and have to ambitious an end goal,
> hopefully making it easier to understand, pickup and contribute.

> **A:** It was good to only have one small thing to contribute and I
> appreciate that given it is 2am

> **Selena:** there was also such a varied experience level

> **Sam:** it must be hard to find a part of the project that everyone can join
> in on.

> **Selena:** our main focus was to get everyone involved. Last rails camp not
> much coding was happening and that is a shame for a lot of junior people come
> to these events and they could have really benefitted from talking to people
> with more experience.

> I feel the landscape of people coming to Rails Camp is chaining. In the last
> 4 or 5 camps a lot of regulars are dropping off and new people are joining in
> at a much more junior level looking at opportunities to get into the
> industry.

> **Sam:** my experience is around people needing help around mirrors and
> servers setup, I don't tend to stick around beyond solving a problem and
> giving them some runway to keep them going for some time.

> **Selena:** It's good you are willing to help

> **Sam:** there is a high impetus to reach out

> **Selena:** there is someone we talked to earlier on. We helped with `rails
> new`. She told us she was not sure if she was going to do any coding. After
> our pairing. We saw her get her laptop out later on, no doubt we were an
> encouragement.

> **Selena:** We think it is intimidating for more junior people to come up to
> more senior people to get help.

> **Sam:** How can we help these people, organically talking at lunch?

> **Selena:** Each camp people mention that more encouragement needs to happen
> to get people writing more code. This camp being small made it easier to
> connect with more people. It should also be on the senior people to reach out
> to the more junior that need the help.

> **Sam:** camps vary, some times it's more games, some times coding, or
> drinking.

> **Q:** any feedback for us?

> **A:** it was fine, even when you said "you are going to get me"
