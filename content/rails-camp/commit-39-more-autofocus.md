**TODO**

how experience - I stayed up waiting for my     go

I liked the concept of everyone from camp collaborating on one project and the
git commit history is nice way of connecting everyone

I think you can go to market even though I did not expect it to work the way
it did - i needed more guidance

We did not get too deep end goals

we just had one thing and I appreciate that given it is 2am

SS varied experience level

it was hard to find to find a place where everyone can join

our main focus was to get everyone involved and last rails camp not much coding and
that is a shame for a lot of junior people where those people could have
benefit-ed from talking to people there

Landscape of people coming to RailsCamp is chaining and last 4 or 5 people
are dropping and new coming in at junior level looking at opportunities to get
in

my experience is around people needing help around mirrors and servers setup

I don't tend to stick around beyond solving a problem and giving them some
runway to keep them going for some time

SS It's good you are willing to help

Sam High impetus to reach out

SS someone we talked to early on we helped with rails new and saw her have
her laptop out later on no doubt we were an encouragement

SS it is intimidating for people to come up to more senior people to get help

Sam - how can we help these people, organically talking at lunch?

SS each camp people mention that more encouragement needs to happen and
this camp being small was easier to get to cache to more people
it should be on the senior people to reach out

Sam - camps vary, games, coding, drinking,

Feedback for us - "it was fine" even when you said you are going to get youe
