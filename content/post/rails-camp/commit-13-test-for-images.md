**TODO** fix

  what time is it 2am

  some testing, practiced it in react

  is there more to it?

  did you learn anything new? yeah the testing framework Jest and the idea of
  --watch as welll enzyme testing for snapshot testing

  we learnt on the routes exact={true} can simply be exact

  also learn about <React.Fragment> or simply <> </> WOW

  what was the highlihgt? talking to us? I knew it!

  no it was cool, it was fun

  what do you want to do next? more testing?

  no going to bed, I am always excited about going to bed!
