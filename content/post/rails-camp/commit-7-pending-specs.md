Wrote test then we scared him with imminent Whoop Whoop of fire alarm and what
he would do? Brenton said “leave the building” we said “Pend the test and push
to master”

Goal for the weekend: to write a proposal for Elixir conf

WIP you would clean up and remove from history
with interactive rebase and force push

it was fun, got a window into the way you approach someone you don't know
do you want to pair
approachable
made it easy asked about the tools
no assumptions - got to drive
considerate about vim bindings

mostly attentions form how you have treated me.

still would not want to work with capybara although your process osunds
interesting
