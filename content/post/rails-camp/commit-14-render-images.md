**TODO**
  built the app for the meetup - the game broke on my mobile - wawaei - score of
  zero

  what have you got out of it?
  never did any testing in any capacity, never did it before.

  heard of TDD, it will open up my employment purposes - interested in knowing
  what it is to implement it into your work, code, and home life yep 100%

  nah like testing is cool, I have always thought of how it would work and now I
  have seen it

  I did a memorial for a mother - strength, hope and courage and I miss splet it
  strength after 2 hours she put it on facebook before anyone realised

  Fucking up tattoos and then covering them up to pass - test driven tattooing

  after the fuck up I paid for laser removal and fix it

  I tattooed her a few times before the accident, pretty close as tattooer and
  client. It was pretty shitty, and it is shitty for her, she was cool about it,
  it still sux,
