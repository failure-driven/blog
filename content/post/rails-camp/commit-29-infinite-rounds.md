**TODO**

I feel like the last 5 years of my life have been wasted (re react vs ember)

I have been wanting to create a react app to play with and someone to guide me
thorugh is great.

I know the benefits of react but see pain points that would ge ton my nervers
snapshots - still not confinced, sketecism

I use tests to write components, the test builds it for me as I look at the
test it helps me write the compnent
maybe for designers, but if the snapshot is goint to break each time I change
it Idon't want to click yeah yeah yah yeah

I don't want to bad mouth it ti ll I use it wiht intent

Have used Ruby Mine use VSCode but yse the vi react emulater

Fantastic, give everyone a chance to experienc pairing and get something
happen. and give evryone the experinece
o
there is a lot of effort in this well done gusy

maybe next time a rails ember app for people to contribute

I ahve learnt Yes I want to dig into the router a bit more, you get it for
free in ember, the router woorks just test the routes

"hard to find enough people in Aus but you maybe need less ember devs then react
sas there

Only this one - point at Ss isfun - mm is intimidating

we pair a fair bit at 2redkites - help most of my team not the rest because
the rest of the team is Nigel

Good use of a rails camp to hae an organised way of getting beginners more up
to speed and get them to play with code is a core focus

"thank you, thank you for doing it"
