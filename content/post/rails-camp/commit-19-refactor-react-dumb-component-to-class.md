didn't know what to expect byt it was fantastic, my expectations were
exceeded.

coded on stats from git and build kite as a dashboard

what did you learn? so quick to forget JS and react, syntax not at fingers
after a few years.

Hard as JS keeps changine every day

just syntax is slightly different native to react just render views

would you like to try ember? NO, I don't think so.

don't pair, but did at lonely planet, it was intenxwe and exhausting and
introverts vs extorverts, broke some peope, it is a balance. it was intense

less imacs then people, you had to pair, no breathing space. Casually pairing
is better on a specificc problem where I am we do it sparingly. have to have
good piring etiquette - hard to
you gusy can get anyone off the stree as you have good pairing ness

hvave keyboard hogs, twitter on the side not good

once peopel are senior they are stuck intheir midset

2 seniors do the correecct solution pairing is good
part of the culture of the compnay to not pair - couter revolutionar

agile back then was iterative delivery, pariing, but lots of projects diied if
they couldn't delver at all

I have seen agile as managemetn methodology and XP as practices,
consultancies, scrum masters, not implemtn, have meetings, backlog grooming,
etc but does it improve everything
