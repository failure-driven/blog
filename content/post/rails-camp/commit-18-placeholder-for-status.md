**TODO**

how did you find it?  fun interesting?
I would do it again, it was good insight to features I have not seen before
and I could possibly use,
found it useful

I was good with pair programming and quite like it. there were a few things I
havenlt done much rails moving to JS learning a new thing and rails not yet
solifidifed - forgot some rails - didln't knoww what you want me to do but
made sens in the end

pretty much none testing CO have used binding.pry but al testing ismanually
clicking.

very hard to write tests if you don't know how to code Selena

Lauracen no idea how to write test but I paired with Ss anddmm andstill no
idea how towrite a test

"Thank you, if I had to settle on smehtning that was interests"
