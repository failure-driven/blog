lot's of new things, RSpec, those test frameworks, I do coding but not main
part of the job, lot of batch files. lot of that stuff can do things you would
not expect it to be able to do

Not so much web apps.

currently changing a client over from G suite to office 365 - reason government
clients want data sovereignty

They put it in unencrypted email but in as long as it is in Australia then it
is ok

DnD more freedom with human as a backend (as opposed to computer game play)
like a mechanical turk
