Everyone has their quirks and like to add their own personal flavour to things. Especially things 
they use a lot. Things like, I don’t know, their computer?!

Modifications to your personal set up are awesome! They’re fun, they let you experiment and distinguish 
your own style.

But keep one thing in mind. Good software development is built by collaboration and just like the 
thought of writing complicated code that your peers can’t understand, having a setup that your peers 
can’t navigate is only going to lead to frustration, confusion and a barrier to your progress.

Although sticking to the least custom setup possible seems like the ultimate solution to some and like 
boredom to others, minimal customisations do stand their ground. A great example is aliases for `git` 
commands. 

Any developer using [source control] (which all of them are), uses these commands on a daily basis, 
constantly committing, pushing, pulling, rebasing, which can become a bit tedious. But to be honest, 
after a while it just becomes a habit. Even still, typing two letters is a lot quicker and easier than 
typing two words so many of those developers will also alias commands like `git status` to `gs`. Which 
again is awesome!

But … I can rant for pages about why alias for shitty little commands like git is a fucken stupid thing. 
I’m going to make this another article.


Could add something here about custom setups and trying to keep the least custom setup possible - also 
being open to whatever setup you encounter, the setup should be like visiting a new bar, it should be 
exciting to see the decor, the vibe, the speciality drinks, the attitude of the staff - ultimately keep 
an open mind for working on someone else's machine and if you invite someone to use your machine be 
welcoming and helpful in giving a guided tour.
